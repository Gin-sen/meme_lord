# Meme Notes

Keep your meme-game up-to-date.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** GitBook is a great place to store your memes, giving folks access to memes from every shitpost you've met. This template is structured in a way that gives collaborative, open note-taking centre stage. There's no reason why you can't use it for private or personal memes notes though!
